## Features Of Nopyfy for getting Victim data
- PHP Webserver (Only Php version 5.6 are supported)
- SMTP Mail
- Ftp Server(Encrypted form)
- Save localy(With encrypted password and Victim data)

## Under PHP Webserver
- Web-panel
- MySql database
- Php mail 
- localy save data(in your server)

## Power Of encryption
In line 44, change `100 byte` to your desirable number. It will Change encryption key and make it trillion in one and generate 10 digit password that required for decrption and encryption of password will be done by your password that you enter(8 digit password are allowed only)




***Use any web server but set his php version to `5.6`***</br>

after creating web server, create subdomain or directly go-to Server folder which you download recently and Set Webpannel username and password, find `check.php` file, open it and in line 5 `$password = "test";`, replace your password with `test`, then go to  line 16 `$username == "test"`and replace with your username (If you don't change this, then default username and password is `test`).Then go to cpanel(web server) and find MySql database and open it, after that find import button and choose `import.sql` in Server Folder. After that open connect_db.php change `localhost` to provided server or leave it (if you are using same platform for creating webserver and MySql server) and in `root` to your MySql username and in `password` write your MySql password and in line 3 `my_db` change this with your database name. If you want to use php email then open write.php file and in line 47 write your email(this feature is for only those people who have persnoal domain).</br>

***After completing above setup follow these step - ***</br>

Go-to file manger of your domain and upload Server folder under domain (Ex - my domain "client.infutureworld.xyz" and after upload Server folder it will "client.infutureworld.xyz/Server"). If you follow above steps correctly then your php url will in this format `http://example.com` + `/Server/write.php`(Ex - `http://example.com/Server/write.php`)

## What Nopyfy do
First he generate password and encrypt file with symmetric AES algorithm method. List of files they encrypt - </br>
".txt", ".jar", ".exe", ".dat", ".contact" , ".settings", ".doc", ".docx", ".xls", ".xlsx", ".ppt", ".pptx", ".odt", ".jpg", ".png", ".csv", ".py", ".sql", ".mdb", ".sln", ".php", ".asp", ".aspx", ".html", ".htm", ".xml", ".psd" , ".pdf" , ".dll" , ".c" , ".cs", ".mp3" , ".mp4", ".f3d" , ".dwg" , ".cpp" , ".zip" , ".rar" , ".mov" , ".rtf" , ".bmp" , ".mkv" , ".avi" , ".apk" , ".lnk" , ".iso", ".7-zip", ".ace", ".arj", ".bz2", ".cab", ".gzip", ".lzh", ".tar", ".uue", ".xz", ".z", ".001", ".mpeg", ".mp3", ".mpg", ".core", ".crproj" , ".pdb", ".ico" , ".pas" , ".db" ,  ".torrent"

***You can also add extention in line 351 but don't add .ini file because it will crash pc ***</br>

during encryption Nopyfy create READ_IT.txt and write your massage(you can edit massage in line 561) and save it in many location for preventing data lost because in readme file it include encrypted victimdata with name id . After this process of sending password to our server are start. first he send Victim data to PHP server and then he send smtp mail and then he create a file with name of pc and also add some generated word(this will prevent data rewrites on fpt server file) and then he save encrypted user detail and send it to ftp server.  

## How to use Nopyfy-Decrypter

### How to use
After any vitim get successfull attack,goto task manager and end process of Nopyfy or restart pc </br>

- goto mail app and you will saw a mail that subject is as well as victim pc nam,open it and copy password
- goto ftp account(where you provide link in line 84) and you will see file that name as pc name and some random word, open it and copy password
- goto `Server` folder of file manager and find result.txt file, open it and copy password
- If you are using Php mail then you will also receive mail (to or from), open it and copy password
- goto MySql database and find `victim` , goto victim and copy password
- If vitim are offline on time of attack, then in encrypted form data of vitim(password, time, username, etc) are also save in all READ_IT.txt file in end of file with name id. when victim contact you, tell him for sending his id to you and then you use Nopyfy-information-decrypter for getting victim data and password.
